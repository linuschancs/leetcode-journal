# Welcome to Linus' Leetcode Journal

Good day! This is an archive of all the leetcode questions I have attempted with my attempted solutions and thought process behind tackling these problems. 
I started this journal to develop a routine of practising leetcode questions and to pen down my analysis, especially techniques or patterns that I discovered while attempting these questions for future reflection.

DISCLAIMER: These solutions may not be the ideal or best solutions but is what I came up with when attempting these questions.
